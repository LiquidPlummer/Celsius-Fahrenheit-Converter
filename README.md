# Celsius-Fahrenheit-Converter

Build a Celsius-Fahrenheit converter. Create a new react app and add several components. You will need one component for Fahrenheit and another for Celsius. These will need to be nested within a parent component. Each component requires a text field to display the current tempreture and an input field to input a new tempreture. Whenever a tempreture is inputted in either component, it should send that information to the parent, perform a conversion from one scale to the other, and update both components to display the correct tempretures.
